# NewtonsZeroCalc
Zero Calculator based on Newtons Method of Approximation.  
Done as an assignment for my AP Calculus class.  
I used NetBeans GUI builder and the exp4j library.  
I was considering building my own expression parser using RPN and shunting yard, but it would have been too much of a pain, soI used exp4j.  

Jar can be found in /dist and should be accompanied by /dist/lib
Source code can be found in /src/newton
