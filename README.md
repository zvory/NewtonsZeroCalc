Done as an assignment for my AP Calculus class.  
I used the exp4j library to evaluate closed form expressions.  
I was considering building my own expression parser using Reverse Polish Notation and the Djikstras Shunting Yard Algorithm, but it would have been too much unecessary work, so I used exp4j.  

Jar can be found in /dist and should be accompanied by /dist/lib  
Source code can be found in /src/newton
